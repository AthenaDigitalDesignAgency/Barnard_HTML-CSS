		<h1>Hi I am Jess!!!</h1>
		<p class="hi">Hi Y'all! I am a crazy Texan here in NYC!I am a huge fan of chocolate, traveling, taking pictures and of course my super cute boyfriend! Oh and I am slowly learning to be more girly, as such I am getting retty darn good at learning how to style my hair and do my nails. Lastly I really believe in being yourself. Do what it takes to get by but always be true to you.
